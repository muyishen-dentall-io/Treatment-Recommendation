告知16結構不佳，建議拔牙，今年八月永和耕莘的抽血報告大致沒問題(因為確診住院?)，但如果診所處理16拔牙要花一些時間，也可以去大醫院處理或是回去討論一下
如果後續要做RPD，可以先嘗試彈性軟床延伸到後牙，如果用起來沒問題，再做正式的

建議37還是可以先觀察，
觀察期: 1個月: 希望疼痛感降低3-4成。3個月: 希望疼痛感降低6-7成。如果館查期間或是回診口內與影像學檢查時，發現自發性疼痛、膿包、根尖病變以及其他需要根管治療的狀況，就會需要做37根管治療。或是疼痛感沒有改善，也可以選擇37根管治療。患者11月底要去東部2周左右。12月中在與患者聯絡約診

病人對於根管治療有疑慮，告知未來會有膿包、感染，甚至是蜂窩性組織炎，而造成呼吸困難甚至死亡之風險，建議不要咬太硬的食物，開止痛藥

 自述在學校摔倒門牙撞斷，1/24就診Dr.賴先用GIC處理(Dr.賴有開診斷證明書)，後來爸爸1/30帶去他家補了11 21 OD

告知媽媽以齒質剩餘結構來說，未來必須要套crown。神經活性還需要觀察，可能為來還是會需要抽神經。PDL可能會因為trauma而沾黏鈣化，建議可以先由高醫師評估是否可以矯正(媽媽希望大學後再矯正)

20240527 上周一(2024/05/20)在嘉義打籃球被手肘打到下顎門牙(有下嘴唇41的位置有傷口)，父母陪同，比起上周，牙齒也比較不痛
做過矯正，有戴上顎維持器，本身也有夜間咬合板，no crown fracture or gumboil, tooth 32 to 42 and 11 21 EPT: normal, take PA, no apical radiolucency, 下顎門牙本來就有space
tooth 31 41 mild mobility，告知父母及病人，未來如果出現牙齒變色、膿包或是根尖病變，可能就會需要抽神經。如果牙齒變色太嚴重，可能就需要做假牙修復。未來可能會有PDL沾黏的狀況，牙齒會無法透過矯正移動","0","MALE","2008-10-03"

看牙會緊張
20241126 爸爸陪同，右下自述喝冷熱都會痛，有時候會有微微陣痛，目前沒有自發性疼痛，大約兩周前Dr.李補46OD，有告知可能會需要抽神經
tooth 46 distal large resin restoration, no gumboil, no percussion or palpation pain, EPT:52/80(ref.tooth 11:50/80), cold test(+, lingering pain 3sec)
tale PA, no apical radiolucency
告知目前46仍有活的神經，可以先觀察，但是如果出現自發性疼痛、膿包，或是未來不好好使用牙線而出現二次蛀牙，就需要做根管治療，如果是柳醫師處理，由於後牙根管系統複雜與患者該年紀的牙根可能仍在發育，會交由根管專科醫師進行顯微根管(1w8-2w2)，開止痛藥備用
